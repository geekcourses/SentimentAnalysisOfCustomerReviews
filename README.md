# Project: Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to classify customer reviews as positive, negative, or neutral, based on a dataset of customer reviews and their associated sentiment labels. Finally, I'll use the trained model to classify new customer reviews and interpret the results.

## Data

I use a dataset containing 18K job descriptions out of which about 800 are fake.
The dataset is freely available on [Kagle: Real / Fake Job Posting Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction/data?select=fake_job_postings.csv). The dataset includes [N] reviews, each labeled as positive, negative, or neutral. The reviews are stored in a CSV file, where each row contains: [describe each dataset column].
